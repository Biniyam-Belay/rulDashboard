## Phase 1: Backend - Model Inference & Core API (Week 2-4)

**Goal:** Get the model making predictions via an API and establish core data handling.

**Tasks & Milestones:**

*   [x] **Model Service - Inference Endpoint (FastAPI):**
    *   [x] Implement logic to load the trained Keras model.
    *   [x] Implement logic to load the `feature_scaler` and `rul_scaler`.

        *   [x] Returns the predicted RUL.
    *   [x] Thoroughly test this endpoint with sample data (manually or with simple scripts).
    *   [x] **Milestone:** Model service can successfully predict RUL from input sequences.

        *   [x] Accepts new raw sensor data for a specific asset.
        *   [x] Prepares the data (fetches recent history to form a sequence if needed).
        *   [x] Calls the Model Service's `/predict` endpoint.
        *   [x] Stores the predicted RUL along with a timestamp and asset ID in the `rul_predictions` table in Supabase.
    *   [x] **Milestone:** New sensor data can trigger RUL prediction and storage.
